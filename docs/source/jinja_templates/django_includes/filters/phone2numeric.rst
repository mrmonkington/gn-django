.. templatefilter:: phone2numeric

``phone2numeric``
-----------------

Converts a phone number (possibly containing letters) to its numerical
equivalent.

The input doesn't have to be a valid phone number. This will happily convert
any string.

For example::

    {{ value|phone2numeric }}

If ``value`` is ``800-COLLECT``, the output will be ``800-2655328``.
