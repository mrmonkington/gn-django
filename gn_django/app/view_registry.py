"""
The view registry allows django apps to progressively override the class based
view that will service a particular url.

Using the registry means we do not need to duplicate url patterns in multiple
apps' `urls.py` files.

An app registers View classes to the registry by declaring a `GNAppConfig` 
subclass in `apps.py`.

All apps' app configs are iterated over to build the global view registry for
a django project.  This occurs the first time that a view is queried for using
the `get` function.
The view registry is populated in the order of `settings.INSTALLED_APPS` 
so that subsequent apps can override the views of preceding apps - this means
that apps lower in `INSTALLED_APPS` will override apps that are higher.

Example: This enables the eurogamer_net app's `content:ArticleView` to override 
the content app's `content:ArticleView`, etc.
